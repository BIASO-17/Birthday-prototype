            Dear Christiana,

            Times passed by; years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes and ticking seconds of me meeting different people from different walks of life, with different characters... I spent time with them, shared love with them, and gave them my all. But they never gave me theirs.
            
            I was that rock hard and solid guy who put his focus in one thing because I didn't want to go through that whole process again. I bared my mind, my heart, turned myself to metal and my feelings to ice. 
            
            But as moments and times would have it, you happened and you were a magnet to stick to my metallic heart and a warm burning candle to melt my hardened ice. Just a smile was enough to get me all over you. 
            
            Love actually just happens and babe, really it just happened. The moments when I'd look at you and wonder why I'm so favored to have a Princess by my side. If I'm what made me love you, it would be because you were just who you were, au naturel. You're a nice little flower that can grow in the harshest conditions and from your inbuilt warmness, fill a whole field with flowers. You're just who you are...and I love you for it. Makes me think and know that I can never and would never erase us.
            
            So on this happy day that is your birthday, a day when a  Royal Queen with the sweetest personality was born, I'd like to thank you for making my life whole, for making me attached to you that a big piece of my heart travels with you where ever you go. Thank you for making timely memories of you and I feel like home so each time my mind wanders it returns back home to you. Thank you my Cherished Angel, for holding my hands and being my backbone in the worst and roughest times and still being the same to annoy me in the cutest ways. We'd never fade, bae, we'd never. I love you for all that you are, you have been and all that you'd ever be. Surely, if you could view yourself the way I see you, you'd have also fallen in love with yourself as madly and crazily as I have. You little munchkin, I'm head over heels, deeply and terribly I love with you. There are countless times when just looking at younis enough to brighten my fallen mood. Considering things, I'm happy you gave me the space to be with you and make memories. When I think of some moments, I realize that I dunno what I'd have ever done without you. People may call it madness, but definitely, I'd call it more love. You only love and get more love by loving. And I can't even get enough of you, in the first place.
            
            So, my honey bunch and butter cup....I wish you the happiest birthday on this gorgeous and splendid day. I actually wish I could turn the hands of the clock, meet you earlier so I'd be able to love you longer. But never mind, Sunshine, I'd bear it because I have you now and I chose you and I'd choose you over and over again, in a hundred life times, a million worlds, and in any version of reality. I'd find you and choose you over and over again. 
            
            Happy Birthday, my Rosy Princess. All my love lies with you.

            from Ife.
